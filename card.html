			<p class="fact">The swallow is called the “bird of freedom” because it cannot endure captivity and will only mate in the wild.</p>

			<p>Swallows are able to produce many different calls or songs, which are used to express excitement, to communicate with others of the same species, during courtship, or as an alarm when a predator is in the area.
				 The typical song of swallows is a simple, sometimes musical twittering. A “tswit-tswit” call is given when a bird of prey is spotted.</p>
